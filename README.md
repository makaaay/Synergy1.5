but i dont know if it is still available now.

the vesion below 1.6 will not need the code to active the sofeware .

if  the active code is not avaliable or you have touble with the vesion above 1.6,you can use ubuntu 1.4.12 and mac 1.5.0 .
it was avaliable in my computers with ubuntu 14.04 and mac.
